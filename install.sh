# No-sudo by design: on many corporate-managed Macs, invoking `sudo` triggers
# an MDM/endpoint-security elevation prompt (e.g. a GUI "Launch with elevated
# privileges" dialog) that never surfaces properly through a piped
# `curl | sudo sh` install, leaving the install permanently stuck with no
# output and no visible prompt. To avoid that entirely, this script never
# calls sudo. It installs into the current user's own bin directory instead
# of a system path that requires root.
#
# Guard against being run with sudo anyway (e.g. out of habit from an old
# README/browser-history command): if invoked as root, `whoami` resolves to
# "root" and everything below would silently install into /var/root instead
# of the real user's home - invisible to that user's own shell afterwards.
# Refuse early with a clear message instead of failing confusingly later.
